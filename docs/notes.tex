    \section{What Are We Doing}
    This project is basically to learn the basic of game development.
    I think this is good way on tracking the development step by step.
    Since the original course uses different folder each session it is kind of hassle.
    I want to make the whole development step into one project or at least one folder. 

    \section{Class in Lua}
    By default Lua as programming language does not have class. 
    I need to find another alternative if I want to utilize the object oriented programming concept to the coding. 
    Here is the beginning of the learning link. 
    \href{http://lua-users.org/wiki/SimpleLuaClasses}{This wiki page of lua-users talk about Simple Lua classes concept}.

    From the official Lua website documentation there are also some papers that talk about simulating class behavior.
    We can start from \href{https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html#16}{the content of the Object Oriented Programming docs}.
    From there we can follow the link that specific talking about classes. 
    For simplicity sake I will put the link the \href{https://www.lua.org/pil/16.1.html}{Classes official documentation page}.
