# NEW PONG
This is the pong for gaming creation course.
I decided to make a new file in order to make the process simpler in one directory.

Here I can make the virtual screen size using the [Ulydev push libs](https://github.com/Ulydev/push). (learn this more I guess.)
Note to self: Lua function does not support parameter assignment and thus no default function parameter values. 
So simple a Lua programming language is it has no fancy features even on its syntatic function feature. I just have to live with it. 
One thing I must remember is to always read the documentation because the sequence of the parameter values inputs are important!

Pong Day 2:
1. make the game scene (ball, stick, and scores)
1. make the stick for player 1 and player 2 moves when certain key is pressed down (hold)!
