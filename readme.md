# NEW PONG
This is the pong for gaming creation course.
I decided to make a new file in order to make the process simpler in one directory.

Pong Day One: What I need to do?
1. first I need to make the front welcome page.
1. Here I can make the virtual screen size using the [Ulydev push libs](https://github.com/Ulydev/push). (learn this more I guess.)

Note to self: Lua function does not support parameter assignment and thus no default function parameter values. 
So simple a Lua programming language is it has no fancy features even on its syntatic function feature. I just have to live with it. 
One thing I must remember is to always read the documentation because the sequence of the parameter values inputs are important!
