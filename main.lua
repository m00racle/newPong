--[[this is the course for code to make game Pong. I restarted the process hoping that I can make all in one window instead of making it pre progress.
I know this will be time consuming to make all from scratch but I an hoping this will make me learn better

]]

--I need to use libreary made by Ulydev in his gitHub repo: https://github.com/Ulydev/push
-- already downloaded and saved the push.lua file thus I need to import it to this main.lua
push = require 'push'
-- set the window size here
WINDOW_HEIGHT = 720
WINDOW_WIDTH = 1280
-- I want virtual sizes (height and width) similar to the old nintendo console.
-- set the virtual sizes here to make the fonts or certain object to change in size even as the resolution is still the same
VIRTUAL_HEIGHT = 243
VIRTUAL_WIDTH = 432


--load the initial settings.
function love.load()
    --set the display (both windows and virtual) 
    -- I want vsync but the user should be prevented to make fullscreen, at this initial stage the user must not allowed to resize the screen.
    push:setupScreen(VIRTUAL_WIDTH, VIRTUAL_HEIGHT, WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT, {fullscreen=false, vsync=true, resizable=false})
    --set the title of the game in the window to identify that we are runnig the correct app
    love.window.setTitle('The New Pong!')
end

--I want to make the apps quit when the user hit the escape key
function love.keypressed(key)
    if key == 'escape' then
        --escape means quit the window
        love.event.quit()
    end

end
